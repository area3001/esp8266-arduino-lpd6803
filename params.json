In this example we used the [TXB0102](http://www.ti.com/product/txb0102) voltage-level translator. Since the signal is being bit banged you can use any available GPIO pin. In our examples we use GPIO 13 as data pin and GPIO 14 as clock pin.\r\n\r\n![Example Schematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/area3001/esp8266-arduino-lpd6803/master/img/connection.png)\r\n","google":"UA-35123769-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
